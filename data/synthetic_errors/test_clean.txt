Are you all resolved to give your voices
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
To have my praise for this, perform a part
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish
Not out of doors
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Be thus to them
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
CORIOLANUS:
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
show you, which shall be yours in private
Of what we chance to sentence
MENENIUS:
MENENIUS:
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
MENENIUS:
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
SICINIUS:
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or hailstone in the sun
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
victory in his pocket
nine that I know
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
SICINIUS:
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
VIRGILIA:
First Senator:
Lead'st first to win some vantage
This but done,
Be taken from the people
Thou hast not done before
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour
Hear me speak:
and give out
Calmly, I do beseech you
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
Nor I
SICINIUS:
I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Be calm, be calm
CORIOLANUS:
CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain
And, being angry, does forget that ever
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
'Fore me, this fellow speaks
They would not thread the gates
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
You speak o' the people,
Chide me no more
O, doubt not that;
I have your alms: adieu
Than the rebuke you give it
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
To a cruel
COMINIUS:
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
BRUTUS:
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
I thank you, general;
Beneath abhorring
MENENIUS:
To Rome of our success
MENENIUS:
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
Nay, let them follow:
you were used
Well, say
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
COMINIUS:
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Citizens:
You worthy tribunes,--
COMINIUS:
Say we read lectures to you
Why, this was known before
'Tis warm at 's heart
Citizens:
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius
me
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
COMINIUS:
One word, good citizens
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
Why then should I be consul
BRUTUS:
MARCIUS:
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
And bear him to the rock
First Senator:
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
Marcius, his name
Enforce the present execution
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
BRUTUS:
MENENIUS:
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
You common cry of curs
Senators:
Citizens:
As I have set them down
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude
Then our office may,
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
I have the letter here; yes, here it is
SICINIUS:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak
solemness out o' door
Both:
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
The addition nobly ever
Despising,
That would depopulate the city and
You have received many wounds for your country
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
SICINIUS:
We do request your kindest ears, and after,
You know the cause, air, of my standing here
SICINIUS:
SICINIUS:
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
His absolute 'shall'
MENENIUS:
With cloth of any colour
Making not reservation of yourselves,
COMINIUS:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
From rascals worse than they
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
For the dearth,
Do as thou list
Lay
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
Citizens:
VALERIA:
With other muniments and petty helps
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee
In praises sauced with lies
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
Which else would put you to your fortune and
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Will the time serve to tell
MENENIUS:
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
He has it now, and by his looks methink
Your fellow tribune
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
On, to the Capitol
And by his rare example made the coward
SICINIUS:
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
SICINIUS:
SICINIUS:
Thou wast a soldier
Stand fast;
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
Spoke he of me
by threes
Masters o' the people,
Than are upon you yet
Pray you, let's to him
Masters, lay down your weapons
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
BRUTUS:
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
I cannot do it to the gods;
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
MENENIUS:
Second Soldier:
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
First Citizen:
And, when it bows, stands up
CORIOLANUS:
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
More than a wild exposture to each chance
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
Fourth Citizen:
'
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
it follows,
MENENIUS:
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
dislikes, to flatter them for their love
We prove this very hour
Sir, those cold ways,
MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
For an end,
VOLUMNIA:
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't
MENENIUS:
Bid them wash their faces
So criminal and in such capital kind,
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
With as big heart as thou
The gods forbid
I would they were in Tiber
All:
O,
SICINIUS:
'That I receive the general food at first,
Third Citizen:
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
First Citizen:
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
Both Tribunes:
What is granted them
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
My mother, you wot well
Help Marcius, help,
CORIOLANUS:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away
Think you so
Tribunes, withdraw awhile
MENENIUS:
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
LARTIUS:
AUFIDIUS:
One that speaks thus their voice
As I guess, Marcius,
We hate alike:
And hews down oaks with rushes
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
CORIOLANUS:
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
CORIOLANUS:
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
With flight and agued fear
Within this mile and half
MENENIUS:
Third Citizen:
I shall tell you
Let them hang
If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
CORIOLANUS:
As with a man busied about decrees:
List to your tribunes
CORIOLANUS:
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
His deeds with doing them, and is content
MENENIUS:
We have as many friends as enemies
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
In human action and capacity,
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
MENENIUS:
will you dismiss the people
Before the common distribution, at
whose rage doth rend
Now we have shown our power,
Than thou of them
Our Rome will cast upon thee
COMINIUS:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
I muse my mother
the one affrights you,
VOLUMNIA:
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
You two
VIRGILIA:
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you
To speak of peace or war
good voice, sir; what say you
The one by the other
LARTIUS:
Fan you into despair
O, good madam, there can be none yet
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
A shield as hard as his
And follow to thine answer
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
They have placed their men of trust
Where is this viper
Nay, more,
VALERIA:
First Citizen:
No public benefit which you receive
Or let us lose it
As if you were a god to punish, not
Not in this heat, sir, now
And will deny him:
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily
