In our first way

Have you collected them by tribes

First Senator:
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
What is become of Marcius
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,

How many stand
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
MENENIUS:
SICINIUS:
I have lived
MENENIUS:
Out of thy garments
I say it shall be so
He shall, sure on't
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee

CORIOLANUS:

Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
Repent in their election

Of more strong link asunder than can ever

As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius

Second Roman:

For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,

Before and in Corioli, let me say,
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
To yield what passes here

To hide your doings; and to silence that,

Be singly counterpoised

But was a petty servant to the state,
he would show most love
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
CORIOLANUS:
Advance,
Well, here he comes
To gnaw their garners
I would dissemble with my nature where
We'll attend you there:
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely

Indeed, you shall not

COMINIUS:
Confusion's near; I cannot speak
In peril of precipitation
As any ear can hear
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
A most inherent baseness
MARCIUS:
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
More cruel to your good report than grateful

And mountainous error be too highly heapt

Cushions, leaden spoons,

With only suffering stain by him; for him

Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
To pluck away their power, as now at last

Fare ye well:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
Which he so sets at nought

The man I am

Of that integrity which should become't,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome

Bastards and all
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,

That shall remain a poison where it is,
Come, sir, along with us
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
And only hitherward
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
Help, ye citizens
Third Citizen:
Than those she placeth highest
BRUTUS:
Aufidius got off

You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but

Sir, sir,--
He cannot temperately transport his honours
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler

There is a world elsewhere

Second Citizen:
CORIOLANUS:
He has our voices, sir
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,

Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved

Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
BRUTUS:
CORIOLANUS:
'Twere well
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us
CORIOLANUS:
I may be consul
Therefore, beseech you,--
MENENIUS:
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us

If it be honour in your wars to seem
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition
malice in my breath
Five times, Marcius,
COMINIUS:
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
And you will rather show our general louts
Or be accused of folly
Envied against the people, seeking means
See what I do deliver out to each,
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
First Citizen:
you were got in fear,
You must in no way say he is covetous
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
VIRGILIA:
SICINIUS:
If you submit you to the people's voices,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
Care for us
This man has marr'd his fortune
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
She shall, she shall
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
Noble tribunes,
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
His good sword in his hand
MENENIUS:
He heard the name of death
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
Make yourselves scabs
Will answer in mine honour
I'll buy him of you
How far off lie these armies
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
And follow Marcius
A letter for me
LARTIUS:
What then, sir
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
The charges of our friends
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
disease our better mirth
More worthier than their voices
Come; I would your cambric
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,

To yield your voices
VALERIA:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall

O, no, no, no
First Senator:
He that has but effected his good will
In his behalf
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
With bats and clubs
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
Our spoils he kick'd at,
With precepts that would make invincible
What is it
What you have nobly done
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Do your will
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
And topping all others in boasting
No, Caius Marcius;
First Citizen:
are coming
And throw their power i' the dust
Prithee now,
What's the matter
The vantage of his anger
MARCIUS:
It shall be so
CORIOLANUS:
Second Senator:
Aged sir, hands off
MENENIUS:
BRUTUS:
Upon their ancient malice will forget
MENENIUS:
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
never a worthier man
VOLUMNIA:
Or what is worst will follow
LARTIUS:
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
How accompanied
This is strange
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
Than ever frown in Greece
MENENIUS:
AEdiles, seize him
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Your only choice
Ingratitude is
LARTIUS:
In peace, to his utmost peril
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
CORIOLANUS:
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
There's in all two worthy voices
Amongst your cloven army
Or Jove for's power to thunder
I had rather be their servant in my way,
First Officer:
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
CORIOLANUS:
BRUTUS:
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
Most willingly;
We know your drift: speak what

I' the part that is at mercy
Should know we were afoot
BRUTUS:

The other makes you proud
How lies their battle
First Citizen:
Have the patricians of you
You are like to do such business
The gods begin to mock me
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
VOLUMNIA:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough
LARTIUS:
When yet he was but
But since he hath
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
I can't say your worships have
Note me this, good friend;
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
LARTIUS:
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
CORIOLANUS:
We have ever your good word
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
When he did need your loves, and do you think
and their consent of one direct way should be at
My nobler friends,

Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Amen, amen

Farewell, my wife, my mother:
VALERIA:
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
Never sound more
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Hear you this Triton of the minnows
What do you prate of service
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger
MARCIUS:
CORIOLANUS:
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
being proud
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country
Divide in all with us
COMINIUS:
MARCIUS:
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself
To meet anon, upon your approbation
Though thanks to all, must I select
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
My country's good with a respect more tender,
COMINIUS:
COMINIUS:
VOLUMNIA:
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
Ay, but not mine own desire
CORIOLANUS:
First Citizen:
What is about to be
Is it not yours
They are not such as you
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition
Seventh Citizen:
Have you not set them on
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
true purchasing
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
Leave us to cure this cause
Under Cominius
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
Than when it was a-doing
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave
Menenius ever, ever
brave Titus:
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
He that depends
As if I had received them for the hire
him last night
That in these several places of the city
Why, shall the people give
Look, sir
First Soldier:
Ere stay behind this business
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
a pair of strange ones
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
His pupil age
Second Citizen:
LARTIUS:
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
VIRGILIA:
But yet my caution was more pertinent
MENENIUS:
Ere they lack'd power to cross you
in private;
BRUTUS:
As cause will be obey'd
SICINIUS:
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
Your
SICINIUS:
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
I talk of you:
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
MENENIUS:
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
MENENIUS:
In this our fabric, if that they--
A kinder value of the people than
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
SICINIUS:
Come, come, they are almost here
Hear me, people; peace

MARCIUS:
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Third Citizen:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
Well, mildly be it then
Our swifter composition
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so
is risen: why stay we prating here
Thus to have said,
SICINIUS:
To your remembrances: but you have found,
Give me thy hand: Come
Come, you shall go with us
your voices,
And not our streets with war
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him
CORIOLANUS:
With their refusal, both observe and answer
That, in the official marks invested, you
And I am constant
VIRGILIA:
Before you had worn it out
SICINIUS:
CORIOLANUS:
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
Bold gentleman,
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may
MENENIUS:
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
'
You are transported by calamity
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
They needs must show themselves; which
In this point charge him home, that he affects
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
They've not prepared for us
COMINIUS:
God save your good worships
And live you yet
Nay, but speak not maliciously
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
begged
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
saddle
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
In honour follows Coriolanus
They gave us our demands
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
You see how he intends to use the people
BRUTUS:
Flower of warriors,
First Senator:
That love the fundamental part of state
O, true-bred
second day of audience
MARCIUS:
CORIOLANUS:
That is not glad to see thee
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Not to them all
SICINIUS:
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
CORIOLANUS:
MENENIUS:
CORIOLANUS:
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
This paltering
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them
That like nor peace nor war
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
SICINIUS:
CORIOLANUS:
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
CORIOLANUS:
CORIOLANUS:
AUFIDIUS:
I shall inform them
If you are learn'd,
He doth appear
He dies to-night
LARTIUS:
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
I' the plain way of his merit
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
LARTIUS:
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it
MENENIUS:
But, I beseech you,
you herd of--Boils and plagues
BRUTUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's
CORIOLANUS:
Sir, praise me not;
Let the high office and the honour go
First Citizen:
For their own good and ours
Thou shouldst not scape me here
And I this
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
Where is your ancient courage
that's no matter, the greater part carries it
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
' Pray you, let us go:
COMINIUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a
They ne'er cared for us
First Citizen:
I am half through;
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
CORIOLANUS:
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
Well, well, sir, well
First Citizen:
Nay, temperately; your promise
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
When one but of my ordinance stood up
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
The common muck of the world: he covets less
To break the heart of generosity,
Allow their officers and are content
VOLUMNIA:
Audience: peace, I say
I know, they do attend us
Their banners wave again
That Marcius shall be consul:
ay, I warrant you, and not without his
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
To see inherited my very wishes
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Who is the sink o' the body,--
Speak, good Cominius:
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
Third Citizen:
Let him be call'd for
MENENIUS:
How does your little son
CORIOLANUS:
There's no remedy;
Should be in them to give
and scatter'd,
SICINIUS:
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
At some time when his soaring insolence
MENENIUS:
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further
in whose name myself
Let's be calm
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
He loves your people
And know how we proceed
What makes this change
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty
Does not approve me further, who was wont
What is the city but the people
CORIOLANUS:
They have chose a consul that will from them take
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
What should the people do with these bald tribunes
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Sir, how comes't that you
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
MENENIUS:
They say there's
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
As for my country I have shed my blood,
All:
SICINIUS:
MENENIUS:
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
You show too much of that
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
VOLUMNIA:
As he is proud to do't
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
MENENIUS:
the wounds become him
pricking it for pity
As you have been; that's for my country:
And bring thy news so late
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it
By Jove, 'twould be my mind
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
CORIOLANUS:
No, no, no, no, no
Will not you go
When you are hearing a
Have you
The man I speak of cannot in the world
BRUTUS:
But owe thy pride thyself
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
The people are incensed against him
Than misery itself would give; rewards
Well said, noble woman
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
I may spur on my journey
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
VOLUMNIA:
MENENIUS:
Like graves i' the holy churchyard
approbation
SICINIUS:
O gods
pleasure to you in being so
Pray now, no more: my mother,
BRUTUS:
I have heard you say,
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Wash my fierce hand in's heart
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
'Tis not four days gone
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud
I know no further:
Shouting their emulation
CORIOLANUS:
I do love
having been supple and courteous to the people,
But what is like me formerly
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Well, no more
BRUTUS:
When
CORIOLANUS:
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death
Insisting on the old prerogative
The theme of our assembly
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Know, good mother,
Marcius,
We'll break our walls,
A noble life before a long, and wish
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
In troth, I think she would
As therefore kept to do so
First Senator:
CORIOLANUS:
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
That the precipitation might down stretch
See, they have shut him in
And, mutually participate, did minister
you are manifest house-keepers
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Where's Caius Marcius
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
Will you undo yourselves
SICINIUS:
the love of Juno, let's go
opposite
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
MARCIUS:
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
For we are peremptory to dispatch
AUFIDIUS:
MENENIUS:
You should have said
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
BRUTUS:
Bear
Has said enough
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
O general,
I could beat forty of them
And occupations perish
Your dangerous lenity
First Citizen:
My words disbench'd you not
Can thereto frame his spirit
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
your worships: more of your conversation would
BRUTUS:
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius
MARCIUS:
MENENIUS:
Faith, there had been many great men that have
SICINIUS:
Second Citizen:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Shall I be charged no further than this present
Your belly's answer
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Citizens:
Call me their traitor
In acclamations hyperbolical;
What good condition can a treaty find
With hearts more proof than shields
The price is to ask it kindly
CORIOLANUS:
--Coriolanus must I call thee
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
Were not so rich a jewel
How not your own desire
What do ye talk
confirmed countenance
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth
Have you a catalogue
COMINIUS:
Mend and charge home,
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
Who deserves greatness
To the fairness of my power
A noble wish
Though therein you can never be too noble,
What shouts are these
Therefore lay hold of him;
Indeed, madam
Which we have goaded onward
All Citizens:
COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
VOLUMNIA:
You find him like a soldier: do not take
Being a Volsce, be that I am
SICINIUS:
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Our greatest friends attend us
We shall be charged again
AUFIDIUS:
Citizens:
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Let me desire your company: he must come,
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
First Officer:
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
Mark you that
You blame Marcius for
I sin in envying his nobility,
The aediles, ho
And tent themselves with death
What is the matter
Second Citizen:
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
I do beseech you,
MENENIUS:
VALERIA:
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
MENENIUS:
MENENIUS:
Of his demerits rob Cominius
How youngly he began to serve his country,
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
To spend the time to end it
Second Citizen:
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
SICINIUS:
Both Citizens:
It then remains
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Let's to the Capitol;
Rather our state's defective for requital
CORIOLANUS:
Against a falling fabric
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
What then
So it must fall out
Meeting two such wealsmen as
Why, had your bodies
The worthiest men have done't
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
All the contagion of the south light on you,
MARCIUS:
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
MENENIUS:
CORIOLANUS:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
SICINIUS:
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
The blood I drop is rather physical
And so are like to do
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all
Officer:
VIRGILIA:
BRUTUS:
Of what that want might ruin
I shall be loved when I am lack'd
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
VIRGILIA:
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
CORIOLANUS:
VOLUMNIA:

What would you have, you curs,
Be hostages for Rome
'Twas from the canon
Shall darken him for ever
Second Citizen:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
Second Citizen:
We will so: almost all
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
Which our divines lose by 'em
Second Officer:
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve
Commit the war of white and damask in
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter
Being i' the war
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
The faults of fools but folly
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
And power i' the truth o' the cause
Fourth Citizen:
CORIOLANUS:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Lay hands upon him
CORIOLANUS:
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
And mothers that lack sons
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please

Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms
The one side must have bale

For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
Come, we'll inform them

Draw near, ye people

With modest warrant
Down with that sword

Lose those he hath won
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
Lesser his person than an ill report;
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,

He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so

First Soldier:
Please you to march;

When he might act the woman in the scene,
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge

My hazards still have been your solace: and
I will appear, and fight

And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
COMINIUS:
Bid them home:
For 'tis a sore upon us,
I cannot bring
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
how honour would become such a person
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
To stale 't a little more
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
Why did you wish me milder
You do the nobler

Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
Well, I will do't:

May I change these garments

tell you you have good faces
And here remain with your uncertainty
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather

With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And the buildings of my fancy: only

No, good madam; I will not out of doors

Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and

They are worn, lord consul, so,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away

O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Well, sir, what answer made the belly
That's off, that's off;

Let us seem humbler after it is done
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
Rather than fool it so,
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours

prithee, woman,--
First Senator:
To gratify his noble service that
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,

bountiful to the desirers

Proceed by process;
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,

If any such be here--
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a

Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:

All will be naught else

As I do pray the gods
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire

And when such time they have begun to cry,
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy
Citizens:
mark you
For your wants,
And
You shames of Rome
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,

For half a hundred years

As words to little purpose

They know the corn
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
First Senator:
Nothing is done to purpose
COMINIUS:

First, hear me speak

I have a heart as little apt as yours,
I'll give my reasons,
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
First Soldier:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
Nay, my good soldier, up;
I wish
Hadst thou beheld--
I will tell you
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
Let him be apprehended
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome
Peace, peace; be not so loud
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;

Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,

This is strange now: do you two know how you are
Please you
Though there the people had more absolute power,
Which makes me sweat with wrath

Why, how are we censured
After the inveterate hate he bears you
Whiles we have struck,
He hath hereto prized them at

Amen, amen
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
For my prosperity
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
Yield, Marcius, yield
You souls of geese,
BRUTUS:
And by my body's action teach my mind
Wrench up thy power to the highest
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship
Why, so he did, I am sure
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
SICINIUS:
Because that now it lies you on to speak
It is apart
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of

And therefore law shall scorn him further trial

And venomous to thine eyes
BRUTUS:
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
with the oaken garland
For that he has,
Enough, with over-measure
First Citizen:
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
From where he should begin and end, but will
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Of our so frank donation
have strong arms too
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good
Of what is past
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
VOLUMNIA:
CORIOLANUS:
Than hear say how I got them
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
That common chances common men could bear;
LARTIUS:
Well, well, no more
He flouted us downright
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other

The people are abused; set on
What says the other troop

As often as we eat

O, well begg'd
They have a leader,
Of all the voices that we have procured

And for Rome's good

Did not deserve corn gratis
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
I shall discharge to the life
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
BRUTUS:
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
Senators, &C:
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
Fie, fie, fie
Must I then do't to them
Attend upon Cominius to these wars
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
BRUTUS:
SICINIUS:
But when extremities speak
CORIOLANUS:
our drums
Whom late you have named for consul
I'll keep you company
Peace
Go we to our tent:
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
You shall ha' it, worthy sir
And call him noble that was now your hate,
As if I loved my little should be dieted
Are bringing forth our youth
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
SICINIUS:
my prayers; but I cannot go thither
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Merely awry: when he did love his country,
I have; 'tis ready
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common
That most are willing
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him

The gods grant them true

Citizens:
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
Twice being
And pass'd him unelected
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
there's all the love they bear us
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
The common file--a plague
He's sentenced; no more hearing
CORIOLANUS:
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
How is it with Titus Lartius
That we shall hardly in our ages see
All:
Noble Marcius
To hear my nothings monster'd
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
We call a nettle but a nettle and
Ye're long about it
danger where he was like to find fame
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
love not Marcius
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
VOLUMNIA:

Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize

To the Capitol, come:
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
That it shall hold companionship in peace
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Come:
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
CORIOLANUS:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
Thinking upon his services, took from you
What work's, my countrymen, in hand
Messenger:
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
Second Senator:
Each way, to better yours
Think upon me
What, what, what
I'll do well yet
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
SICINIUS:
Than flatter him in a bower
or had you tongues to cry
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
Those are they
That hath received an alms
Have with you
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Then, worthy Marcius,
Here come more voices
In heaps and piles of ruin
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
Second Citizen:
Deserves the extremest death
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
MENENIUS:
First Citizen:
That does appear as he were flay'd
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
Here comes his mother
MARCIUS:
and now again
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
Nay,'tis true
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
That you do speak to the people
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give

That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
If I could shake off but one seven years

O the gods
Your virtue is

You cry against the noble senate, who,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
But how prevail'd you
If I fly, Marcius,
CORIOLANUS:
In wholesome manner
From me do back receive the flour of all,
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
Come on, my fellows:
Where they shall know our mind: away
The former agents, if they did complain,
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
A certain number,
On the sudden,
Say, has our general met the enemy
Why, I pray you
My gracious silence, hail
Consider further,
what barm can your bisson
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
MARCIUS:
Farewell
MENENIUS:
The best, with whom we may articulate,
BRUTUS:
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Yonder comes news
So can I name his faults,--
Unknown to the beginning
MENENIUS:
SICINIUS:
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
--
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
MENENIUS:
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
MENENIUS:
Let them go on;
My first son
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is

So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
CORIOLANUS:
MENENIUS:
Could you not have told him
once to all the points o' the compass

Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people

That hath beside well in his person wrought
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
Was not a man my father
MENENIUS:
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't

It is your former promise
SICINIUS:
For insurrection's arguing
His nature is too noble for the world:
Lieutenant:
That of all things upon the earth he hated
I am out of breath;
VOLUMNIA:
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
Both field and city ours, he never stood
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
This is clean kam
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
COMINIUS:
May they perceive's intent
Let him be made a coverture for the wars
We'll surety him
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
First Citizen:
look upon his school-master
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
you our voices heartily
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
MARCIUS:
VOLUMNIA:
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
My sometime general,
Very well; and could be content to give him good
Messenger:
Or all or lose his hire
CORIOLANUS:
I love them as they weigh
MENENIUS:
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
wounds upon him
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
BRUTUS:
Fear not our care, sir
AUFIDIUS:
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Only fair speech
The honour'd gods
