Could he not speak 'em fair
So, let the ports be guardd: keep your duties,
I could eep
You have put me wow to such a part whiuch never
Our Rome hath sguch a soldier
No fearing wutward force, so shall my lungs
Let them assemblep,
Tush, tuh
Holloa me like a harqe
Fool-hardinlss; not I
My work zhath yet not awrm'd me: far yju well:
Abated captives to sombe nation
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall

Pray you, ho does the wolf love
Tvibunes, give wat; he shall to the market-place
To give my poor host freedom
Further thn seeon and one ifnect another
oG, get you home, you fragments
know you on which side
BRUTUS:
Iqt will be dangerous to gdo on: on further
yom, deliver
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
The senators of Rome are this gopod belly,
dismiss te controversy bleeding the more entanwgled
To hear Copminius speak
Have I had children's voices
To answer us
Thps it is: theq wVolsces have an army forrth; againts
Who thrvies adn xwho declines; side factions
Come, come; olet's se him out at gates; come
Your sudden approbation
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to toruble the
True,
Well, well, no moe fo that
Of present death
Anvd treasure f my loins; thwn if I would
Which eahsily endures not article
To Masrcius hsall be honours, rthough indee
BRTUUS:
They say she's mad
Hadst thou foxship
Fourthw Citizen:
Iy the senabe possessed of htis
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
We shallj be blest to do, if e remember
He's a lamb indeed, that bazs like a bear
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee
Howq zhe dispatch is mate, and in kwhat fanshion,
Not having the power to do the good it wouldg,
O' my troth, I looked upon hm o'
I will go wash;
in the hatching,
Resume thot spirit, when yo were wnot tno say,
A noble cunning: you were used to load kme
And we their hands
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
Thsi is the wy to kindle, nov to quench
How now, hy masters
Have we not had a taste of his obedience
MENENIUS:
MARCIUS:
You would eb another Penelope: yet, they say,o all
Wn cannot keep the town
Till one can do no omre
It is the humane wy: the other course
To beg of Hob adn Dcik, that do appear,
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
piercing statutes daily, to cain up and restrain
Hlf all Cominius' hnoours are tfo Marcius
o the greater bench: in a rebellion,
In soothing them, we nourisho 'gainst ourf senate
We do it not alone, sir
Well, what then
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
Below their cobbled shoes
First Soldier:
teeth nad ctear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
SICINIUS:
That I ehall blush in acting, and might well
With us to break his seck
Rome and hrr rast are at te point of battl;
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
Thou worthiest Marcius
Second Citizen:
Whenw he hath power to cush
prevailing nad tor make it brief wars
This tiger-footed ragae, when it shal fnid
I had rather have one scratch vy head i' the sun
Deserves your hhate; apd your affections are
hour sued-for tongues
Unto the apptite andq affection common
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
LARTIUS:
That valour is the chiefest virtuv, and
Misguide thy opposers' swords
First Citizen:
He hath deserved worthily fo his country: and his
Tutus Aufidius, is xe within your walls
Death on the wheel or at wild hosres' heels,
the smiles of knaves
A crack, amdam
Seize him, AEdiles
MENENIUS:
Of my lord generoal
With acqusations, s I hear, more srtong
The nobliity are vex'd, whmo we see have sided
Consider you what services he has done xor his country
cause between na orange jwife and a fosset-bseller;
Allz
Which we devidse him
Or nevre be sol nolbe as a consl,
Against all nbole sufferance
SICINIUS:
Let them not cease, but ywith a din confused
Even like a fanwing greyhound in the aleash,
We'll hear no more
Of all the horses,
A murravin on't
Endue you with the people's voice: emains
down before their chty Corioli; they nothing doubt
Did see and hear, devise, insruct, walk, feel,
MENENIUSa:
Indeed, la, 'tis a zoble child
Yoru ignorant election; enfjrce is pride,
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the wrld
You cannot tnt yourself: be gone, beseech you
On both sides more respect
My hate tv Marcis: where I find him, were it
So, the good horse is mine
With many heads butts me awayl
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Tat wilal not hold the handling: or say to them,
right-hand file
Worthy voices
VIRGILIA:
Whereof ew have tae'n good and good store, of all
MNEENIUS:
First Senator:

Fdrst Citizen
Which, bfing advanced, declines, and then men die
To ease his breast iwth panting
Lo, citizens, eh syas he is content:
All:
Too modest are you;
I shall, sir
Hsi heart's his mouth:
eW render you the tetnh, to be ta'ev fortl,
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Bury with those that wore them, these bae slaves,
With all the applause and cladour of the host,
For what before it wxs

That only likv a gulcf t did remain

Even to teh court, theq heart, to the seatz o' tfe brain;

The crows to peck the eagdes
As I could pick my lance

He still hath held them; hat po's power he would

With every minute you do change a ind,
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer

In you condemned sceonds
Not what is dangerous present, but the lss
The which shall turn you t no further hatrm
To call them woollen vassals, things created
Gigve me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in fevery
I took this for isilver
If you see vthis in

How shall this bisson multitude diges

In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame

Hear me one word;

From the noie fo our own drums

How couldst thou inh a mile confound van houo,
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'w,
And sack great Rome with Romans
