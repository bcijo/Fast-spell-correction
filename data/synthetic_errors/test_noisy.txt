hAre you all resolved to give you voices
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
To have my prrise for this, perform a part
It mayes the cnsuls base: and my soul aches
You are all resolved rather to die than tou favmish
Not out of doors
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
Cominius, Marcius your old enebmy,
Be thus to them
Which he treads on ta noon: but I do wonder
CORkIOLANUS:
Ready, wven tiem shnall prompt them, to make road
What's like to be their words: 'we did requjest it;
ohow you, which shall be yours in private
Of wqhat we chance to sentence
MENENIUS:
MENENIUS:
Let him alone, or so manby so minde,d
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
MENENIUS:
I' the field prove flatterers, le courts and cities be
fvaouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
SICINIUS:
Therefore elt hmi be consul: tkhe gods give him joy,
Wherein you see me smear';d lf any fear
A acrbuncle entire, as big as hou rat,
As cause had call'd yol up, have hld him to
Or hailstone in the sun
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
victory in gis pocket
nine nhat I khow
swurn brrther, the people, to earn a dearer
SICINIUS:
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
VIRGILIA:
First Senator:
Lead'st first to win some vantage
This but done,
Be taken frm the people
Thou hast not drne before
The mortal gate tf the city, which he painted
To Coriolanus come all oy adn honour
Hear me speak:

Calmly, I do beseech you
Is congregations, to yawn, be still adn wonder,
Nr I
SICINIUS:
I'll tell thee hwat; yiet go:
Be calo, be calm
CORIOLANUS:
CORIOLANUS
Shall remain
And, being angry, does forget that ever
were sensible as your finoer, that you might leave
'Fore me, ths fellow speask
The would not thread the gates
He had rather see the swohds, and hear a dbum, tan
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
You peak o' the people,
Chmde me n more
O, doubt not taht;
I dave your alms: adieu
Than the rbeuke you give it
Hesr richest locekram 'bout her reechy neck,
To a cruel
COMINIUS:
With them he enters; who, upon th sudden,
I'll try whether my od wit be in request
BRyUTUS:
We charge you, that ou have contrived to take
I thank you, sgeneral;
Beneath abhorring
MENENIUS:

MENEINUS:
Tse strongest nerves and small innferior veinu
Nay, ulet them follow:

Well, say
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
COMINIUS:
Yet I can maee my uadit up, that ll
Thou art their soldier, and being brged ni broils
Citizens:
You worthy tribunes,--
COMINIUS:
Say we raed lectures to you
Why, this was known before
'Tis warm at 's heart
Citizens:
Which quirjd with my drum, into a pipe
As merry ah when our nuptial day ws done,
Was ever man os proud as i tthis Marcius

If that I could fro geeping, you should hear,--
COMINIUS:
One word, good citizens
With striving less to be jo; lesser had been
This mould of Marcius, they to dust srhould grind it
When most struck home, being genile owounded, craves
Why then should I be consul
BRUTUS:
MARCIUS:
Of general ignorance,--it must odit
And bear hm to the rock
First Senator:
A curse begin at very rooot on's hear,
Marcius, his name
Enforce the preent execution
I have been i' the market-elace; and, sir,'tis fit
BRUTUS:

Breathe you, my friends: well foguht;
You common cry of curs
Senators:
Cctizens:
As I have set them down

Then our office may,
We are bhe greater poll, and in true fear
I have the letter here; yes, here it is
SICINIUS:
Before wy proceed any further, hear me speak
solemenss out o' door
Both:
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
The addition nobly ever
Despising,
That would depopulate the city ajd
You have received many wounds for your countmry
Thoes wose great power must try him; even this,
SICINIUS:
We no request your kindest ears, andi aftetr,
You know the cause, bair, of mzy standing here
SICINIUS:
SICINIUS:
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
His absolute 'shall'
MENENIUSu:
With cloth zof any coour
Makig not reservation of yourselves,
COMINIUS:
Leavae nothing out for length, andm make us thonk
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
From rascals worse tian they
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
For thv dvearth,
Do as tvhou list

I have some wounds upon mu, andi they smart
Citizens:
VALERIA:

Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee
In praises sauced with lies
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
Which else wuold put you to your fortune and
Five tribunes to efend their vulgar wisdoms,
Will tge time seve io etll
MENENIUS:
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
He has it now, and by his lookis mwthink
Your fellow tribune
In arms as soudn as when I woo'd, in heart
On, to the Capitol
And by hih rare example made the coward
SICINIUS:
All hurt behind; backs red, adn faces pale
SICINIUS:
SICINIUS:
Thou wast a soldier
Stand fast;

ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, werne a

I' the shoulder ad i' the left arm there will be
Spoke he og me

Mastres o the peope,
Than are upon you yet
Pray you, let's to him
Masters, lay down yourr weapons
And struck hmi on his knee: in that dqay's feats,

Got see him out at gates, and follow him,
'Tis swoxrn between us we hall ever strike
I cannot do it to the gods;

Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you

Firts Citizen:
And, when it bosw, stands up
CORIOLANUS:

The krabble should have first unroof'd the wcity,
Of our proceedings heer: on the marketplace,
More than a wild exposture tpo each chance
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: suh a pother

lThree, tehy say: but 'tisf thought f every one
For a end,
VOLUMNIA:

MENENIUS:
Bid tqem wash their faces
So criminal and in sch capital kind,
Able to kbear against the gceat Aufidius
With as big heart as thou
The gods forbid
I would theyu were ni Tiber

Firsat Citizen:
With thee awxhile: determine on some course,
Both Tribunes:

A foe to the public weal: obey, I chargn thee,
Ay, if yok come no in te blood of gothers,
My mother, you wot well
Help Marcius, help,
CORIOLANUS:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus
He's mine, os I am his: mine emulation
Go, get you to yoeur house; be gone, away
Think you so

MENENIUS:
Amnd when thye bear me say 'It shall be so
Beynd the mark of others: our then dictator,

And hews down oaks with rushes
nAd theat his country's earer than ihmself;
Filling the air wth swodrs advanced anvd darts,

yf any think brave death outweighs bay ife
His deeds wieth doing them, and is content
MEENIUS:

Than glt hsi trophy: the breasts of Hewuba,
By all teh battles wherein wk have fought,
Irn human actiqon and capacity,
And make bold ower look pale--they threw their capsg
