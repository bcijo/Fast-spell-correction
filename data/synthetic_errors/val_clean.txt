Could he not speak 'em fair
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
I could weep
You have put me now to such a part which never
Our Rome hath such a soldier
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Let them assemble,
Tush, tush
Holloa me like a hare
Fool-hardiness; not I
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
Abated captives to some nation
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
is, even till the altitude of his virtue
Pray you, who does the wolf love
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place
To give my poor host freedom
Further than seen and one infect another
Go, get you home, you fragments
know you on which side
BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on: no further
you, deliver
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
To hear Cominius speak
Have I had children's voices
To answer us
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come
Your sudden approbation
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
True,
Well, well, no more of that
Of present death
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Which easily endures not article
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
BRUTUS:
They say she's mad
Hadst thou foxship
Fourth Citizen:
Is the senate possessed of this
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
I will go wash;
in the hatching,
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
And we their hands
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
This is the way to kindle, not to quench
How now, my masters
Have we not had a taste of his obedience
MENENIUS:
MARCIUS:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
We cannot keep the town
Till one can do no more
It is the humane way: the other course
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
We do it not alone, sir
Well, what then
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
Below their cobbled shoes
First Soldier:
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
SICINIUS:
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
With us to break his neck
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
Thou worthiest Marcius
Second Citizen:
When he hath power to crush
prevailing and to make it brief wars
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
Your sued-for tongues
Unto the appetite and affection common
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
LARTIUS:
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Misguide thy opposers' swords
First Citizen:
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
the smiles of knaves
A crack, madam
Seize him, AEdiles
MENENIUS:
Of my lord general
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
Consider you what services he has done for his country
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
All:
Which we devise him
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Against all noble sufferance
SICINIUS:
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
We'll hear no more
Of all the horses,
A murrain on't
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
MENENIUS:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you
On both sides more respect
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
So, the good horse is mine
With many heads butts me away
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
right-hand file
Worthy voices
VIRGILIA:
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
MENENIUS:
First Senator:
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
First Citizen:
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die
To ease his breast with panting
Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
All:
Too modest are you;
I shall, sir
His heart's his mouth:
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
For what before it was
Let deeds express
In that there's comfort
All:
Standing your friendly lord
Their needless vouches
MARCIUS:
And no way from yourselves
CORIOLANUS:
SICINIUS:
Second Officer:
Speak that,--
To curb the will of the nobility:
action outdone his former deeds doubly
Second Senator:
BRUTUS:
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
MENENIUS:
Most sweet voices
But had he died in the business, madam; how then
it gives me an estate of seven
This kind of service
I have done
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Saw you Aufidius
But is four Volsces
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
MARCIUS:
The people are the city
I will, sir, flatter my
MENENIUS:
What ever have been thought on in this state,
BRUTUS:
CORIOLANUS:
In bolted language; meal and bran together
And look'd upon things precious as they were
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat
SICINIUS:
the poor
First Officer:
With a kind of smile,
BRUTUS:
Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
That only like a gulf it did remain
There, Coriolanus
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
I shall, my lord
COMINIUS:
Citizens:
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The crows to peck the eagles
As I could pick my lance
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em
BRUTUS:
Custom calls me to't:
Thou injurious tribune
Come, come, you have been too rough, something
Have the power still
Let me speak:
VALERIA:
please you,
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
With every minute you do change a mind,
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
CORIOLANUS:
You shout me forth
First Senator:
VOLUMNIA:
That is the way to lay the city flat;
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
In your condemned seconds
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
The which shall turn you to no further harm
To call them woollen vassals, things created
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
I took this for silver
If you see this in
though I must be content to bear with those that say
How shall this bisson multitude digest
MENENIUS:
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
SICINIUS:
Your voices therefore
MENENIUS:
COMINIUS:
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
Hear me one word;
have not in abundance
From the noise of our own drums
Stop,
MENENIUS:
Our army's in the field
CORIOLANUS:
To better vantage
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
CORIOLANUS:
VOLUMNIA:
Attend us through the city
The heart that conn'd them
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
And sack great Rome with Romans
Before the tag return
COMINIUS:
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
CORIOLANUS:
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Well, what then
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
MARCIUS:
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
You might have been enough the man you are,
customary gown
SICINIUS:
I would have had you put your power well on,
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
BRUTUS:
Thou old and true Menenius,
CORIOLANUS:
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Nor yoke with him for tribune
he was wont to come home wounded
Come, good sweet lady
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
BRUTUS:
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
VIRGILIA:
A hundred thousand welcomes
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech you,
VALERIA:
AEdile:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
SICINIUS:
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
Second Citizen:
If he have power
BRUTUS:
Yet are they passing cowardly
All:
And straight disclaim their tongues
VIRGILIA:
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
AUFIDIUS:
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Pray, be content:
Before-time seen him thus
SICINIUS:
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
I'll be sworn they are true
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
MENENIUS:
Nor ever will be ruled
That babies lulls asleep
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
